# Convolutional Self-Attention Neural Network

This project contains various machine learning model architectures and is meant to facilitate a comparative analysis between them using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

Note: you must be using the Windows operating system (version 10 or higher).

To run each individual script, ensure that all dependencies are installed onto your device:
- Visual Studio Code
- Python 3.8.10 
- PyTorch 2.0.0+cu118 (cuda version 11.8 support)
- Cuda version 11.8

Each script specifies that the training should be done on a NVIDIA GPU. In the event that a NVIDA GPU is not detected upon runtime, the training will instead be done on the CPU.

Once each script has been downloaded to your device, navigate to the start menu and in the search bar, type "cmd". In the command line interface, navigate to the directory containing the python script you wish to run using the "cd" command. From here, run the script by using the command "python 'file'.py". (As a point of clarity, "file" in the preceding sentence should be replaced with the name of the script you wish to run)
