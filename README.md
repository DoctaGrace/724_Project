# 724_Project

This project contains various machine learning model architectures and is meant to facilitate a comparative analysis between them using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.


To run each individual script, ensure that all dependencies are installed onto your device:
- Visual Studio Code
- Python 3.8.10 
- PyTorch 2.0.0+cu118 (cuda version 11.8 support)
- Cuda version 11.8

Each script specifies that the training should be done on a NVIDIA GPU. In the event that a NVIDA GPU is not detected upon runtime, the training will instead be done on the CPU. .
